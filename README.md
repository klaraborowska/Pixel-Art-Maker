## How Does It Work

Enter grid width and height to create the grid. Then pick a color and single click on the cell to change it's color, to remove it double click on the cell. Click and move mouse to draw, press shift and move mouse to erase. By clicking on the bucket the color of the whole drawing surface will be changed. It's possible to add rows and columns to the grid or change size of the cell. To view the drawing you can remove the grid and add white background color.
