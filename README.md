## How Does It Work

Enter a width and height to create a grid. Pick a color and single click on the cell to change its color. To remove a cell, double click on it. Click and move the mouse to draw. Move the mouse while pressing the shift key to erase. By clicking on the bucket the color of the whole drawing surface will be changed. It's possible to add rows and columns to the grid or change the size of the cell. To view the drawing you can remove the grid and add white background color.
